*What would the works of artists Chico da Silva, Aldemir Martins and Raimundo Cela look like, from the perspective of Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet or Van Gogh?*

This collection of illustrations uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to propose a method to understand how these concepts could converge, in addition to bringing up the reflection on the use of AI as a tool for understanding the ability to create visual experiences unique, through the formalization of a complex interaction between an artist's content and style. This work brings to light the concept of ‘Generative Adversary Networks (GAN)’, which is linked to a field in the area of Computer Science, called Deep Neural Networks (Deep Learning). Currently, GANs are considered a vanguard in contemporary art.
