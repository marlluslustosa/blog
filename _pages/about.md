<p>I am a Bachelor in Computer Science at the Federal University of Piauí (UFPI) and master’s degree in Public Policies and Management of Higher Education at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC). I work as an IT Analyst in this same institution (UFC) working in the areas of virtualization and cloud. I have acted (and still work) as a teacher in the area of computing. <p>

<p>But for some time now I am immersing myself in agroecology, ecology, data science, connectivism, cryptocoins, blockchain, social capital, political activism and free and open source software, as well as contributing to projects and ideas that really matter for a democratic internet. I’m a Tor, ZeroNet, Subutai, XCP-ng and federated networks enthusiast. Currently, my newest hobby are Generative Adversary Networks (GANs) as a tool for generating art.
